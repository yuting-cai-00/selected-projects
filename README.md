# Selected Projects — Yuting Cai

A curated set of projects that represent my work in power systems + ML/LLMs.
Each entry includes (1) what it is, (2) what I personally did, and (3) proof links (PRs/commits).

## OpenPowerBench (open-source contribution)
**What it is:** Open-source multi-task dataset + benchmark for power-system foundation models, spanning
topology-dependent tasks (e.g., power flow / OPF / contingency) and topology-independent tasks
(e.g., load forecasting / price prediction).  
**Repo:** https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench

**My contributions (replace with your actual work):**
- Implemented/extended: <module / pipeline piece you owned>
- Added baseline(s): <model name(s)>, training/eval config(s)
- Improved evaluation: <metrics / logging / experiment harness>
- Documentation: <setup docs / examples / tutorials>

**Proof (add your links):**
- PR(s): https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench/pull/<PR_ID>
- Key commit(s): https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench/commit/<SHA>
- Issue(s) / discussions (optional): https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench/issues/<ID>

**Quick run (optional, keep short + accurate):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench
cd OpenPowerBench/topology_independent
pip install -r requirements.txt
# then follow the repo's demo scripts / configs
